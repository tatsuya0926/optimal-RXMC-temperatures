# optimal-RXMC-temperatures

This repository contains the implementation of the gradient-based temperature optimization framework for replica-exchange Monte-Carlo (RXMC) simulations. The method leverages the score function method to compute gradients in spin systems, such as the Ising model.

For a detailed description of the methodology and results, please refer to our paper: [Link to arXiv (https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13542)]
